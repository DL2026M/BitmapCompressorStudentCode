|November 30th  |9:00pm - 9:45pm|I created my github repository for this project and I also re-read the reading assigned to this project to understand the project again (I forgot some stuff during the break). |
 | December 1st | 11:40am - 12:05pm + 7:30pm - 8:45pm| Worked on it a bunch and managed to write complete (though not working fully) code for each of the functions. I am having trouble figuring out what to write in the terminal as I am getting a lot of files not existing. I will meet with you to help me debug my code!
